# Working with a feed-forward ANN

* Submit only this Jupyter Notebook. Make sure the submitted file also works on the provided server.
* **Save** your **results**, do not submit only the code. This means you should run your code, **save** the notebook including your **results (output cells)** and corresponding **explanations**, **download** it and and then submit it in Moodle!
* No changes in the given code above Task 1. Use inheritance or copy the parts you want to change. Existing code can be called/used.
* All descriptions/discussions should be in **your own words**. **Write explanations describing your results and not general sentences**.

Some hints:
* Start early, running the complete notebook can take hours.
* Try to put each task in one single cell.
* Develop your code with a subset of the data, so you can be quite confident that the code executes completely. Then use the complete data set and save your corresponding result.

The assignment is based on the **already given feed-forward ANN during the the course** (Task 1 to 7) and **Keras** (Task 8)!
